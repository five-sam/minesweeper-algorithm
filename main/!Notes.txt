NOTES

- The Board class MUST be a complete blackbox, only printing results, never giving my Solver any extra information
- I need to dedicate an hour to properly set up my Github



SCOPE IDEAS

- Smart Start so you don't start on a mine or a number (at least a 3x3 of safe spaces)
- Giving this an actual GUI would be cool
- I kinda imagine that this wouldn't be too different in higher dimesions, but tbh that kinda sounds hellish to code, especially if it had a GUI
- Also could be interesting to explore different tiling systems
- I could maybe add in chording???
- This really should have some sort of write up attached to it
