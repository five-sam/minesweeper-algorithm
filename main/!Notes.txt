__NOTES__

- The Board class MUST be a complete blackbox, only printing results, never giving my Solver any extra information
- I need to dedicate an hour to properly set up my Github


__SCOPE IDEAS__

Easy:
- Smart Start so you don't start on a mine or a number (at least a 3x3 of safe spaces)
- Adding in the chording action (middle click)
- Bigger explosion

Medium:
- Giving this an actual GUI would be cool
- This really should have some sort of write up once I'm done
- Option of borderless

Hard:
- Infinite minesweeper???
- Could be interesting to explore different tilings besides square (triangular, hexagonal, that weird einstein tile)
- I kinda imagine that this wouldn't be too different in higher dimesions, but tbh that kinda sounds hellish to code, especially if it had a GUI
